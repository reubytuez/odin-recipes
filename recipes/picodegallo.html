            <h4>What is Pico De Gallo?</h4>
            Also called salsa fresca or salsa cruda, pico de gallo is a fresh Mexican salsa made of finely chopped ripe tomatoes, onion, cilantro, jalapeño, and lime. 
            In English, its name literally means “rooster’s beak,” though there’s no definitive reason <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_de_gallo">we call it that.</a>
